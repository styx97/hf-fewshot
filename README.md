# hf-fewshot
A barebones set of utilities to perform pairwise comparisons to estimate scores of text items along a particular dimension. 

### What this package does

This package provides a simple interface to perform zero/few-shot inference using LLMs hosted on huggingface. Features include quantization, dynamic batching, etc. 

This package also contains code accompanying the paper [PairScale](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.94/), including end-to-end code on generating scores from pairwise comparisons.
